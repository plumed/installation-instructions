<h2>Setting up your environment</h2>
<p>Once the installation and testing has been completed you are ready to use PLUMED. Running PLUMED will be more straightforward if you set up the environment correctly.
If the environment is setup correctly you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> use the <code>plumed</code> executable from the command line. Notice that you can also use this executable before installing. </li>
<li> link against the PLUMED library using the <code>-lplumed</code> flag for the linker. If this flag can be employed then it is possible to use PLUMED library in general purpose programs </li>
<li> use PLUMED internal functionality (C++ classes) including header files such as <code>#include <plumed/tools/Vector.h></code> in general purpose programs </li>
</ul>
