<h1> Building multiple PLUMED versions </h1>
<h2>Configuring PLUMED</h2>

<p>The first step in building PLUMED is to configure the makefiles based on the setup of your computer. If you would like to have multiple versions of the code
installed on your computer, you will also need to give them all different names and place them in different locations. You will thus need to use a configure
command such as the one below: </p>

@configure("./configure prefix=$HOME/opt --program-suffix=2.2 --program-prefix=mpi-" multiinp1)@

<p>By using this command you ensure that the PLUMED executible will be named <code>mpi-plumed2.2</code> and that other PLUMED files will be named similarly. To load this PLUMED library
you will thus need to use the flag <code>-lmpi-plumed2.2</code>. PLUMED header files would then be included by using <code>#include <mpi-plumed_2.2/tools/Vector.h></code>.
It is also possible to use arbitrary scripts to edit the name of the executable by adding the option <code>--program-transform-name=PROGRAM</code> to your configure command.
(see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Transformation-Examples.html#Transformation-Examples"> autoconf documentation </a> for more info).
This options is useful if you do not want to set up modules. As detailed below, however, we believe that using modules is more flexible.</p>
