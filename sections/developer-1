<h1> Building PLUMED for development purposes </h1>
<h2>Configuring PLUMED</h2>

<p>The first step in building PLUMED is to configure the makefiles based on the setup of your computer. If you are developing PLUMED, we recommend that you configure
using the options below:</p>

@configure("./configure --enable-modules=all --enable-mpi --enable-debug" devinp1)@

<p>Once you are confident that your feature is working correctly you can then reconfigure and compile an optimized version of the code.</p>

<p>You can control the compilers and compiler flags that are used to build PLUMED by setting the environment variables. For example, if you wanted to use
the icpc and icc compilers you might use the command shown in the example below:</p>

@configure("./configure CXX=icpc CC=icc CXXFLAGS=-O3 LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LIBS=-lmyxdrfile" devinp2)@
