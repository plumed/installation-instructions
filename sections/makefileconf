<p>The most important variables to edit in the Makefile.conf file are:</p>
<ul>
<li> DYNAMIC_LIB : the libraries (e.g. BLAS and LAPACK) that are linked when the the PLUMED library is compiled are listed here.
Flags such as -L/path/to/xdrfile -lxdrfile that were specified using the environment variables <code>LDFLAGS</code> and <code>LIBS</code>
in the call to <code>configure</code> will appear here. The fact that the flags specified using <code>LIBS</code> is perhaps confusing but this
is necessary to keep the configuration files compatible with PLUMED 2.0. Notice that for the PLUMED shared library to be compiled correctly only dynamic libraries should be listed here.</li>
<li> LIBS : the libraries that are needed to patching the MD codes (typically only <code>-ldl</code> which is needed to have functions for dynamic loading) are specified here.</li>
<li> CPPFLAGS : definitions that are needed to enable specific optional functions (e.g. -D__PLUMED_HAS_XDRFILE to enable the xdrfile library) are specified here.</li>
<li> SOEXT : the extension for shared libraries on your system is specified here. Typically an "so" extension is used on UNIX and a "dylib" extension is used on mac.
If your system does not support dynamic libraries or if you would like a static executable you can just set this variable blank i.e. <code>SOEXT=</code>. </li>
</ul>
