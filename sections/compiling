<h2>Compiling PLUMED</h2>
<p>PLUMED can be compiled using the following command once the <code>configure</code> script has finished running:</p>
<pre class="fragment">
&gt; make -j 4
</pre>
<p>This command compiles the entire code and produces a number of files in the <code>src/lib</code> directory, including the executable
<code>src/lib/plumed</code>. If the shared libraries are enabled a shared libraries called <code>src/lib/libKernel.so</code> should also be generated.
The extension for this file will be <code>.dylib</code> if you are building PLUMED on a Mac. There are some rare occasions when this command fails
because the configure script fails to find some of the required libraries. If this happens you can <a onclick='showData("makefileconf","makeconfdiv")'>edit the Makefile.conf file</a> so that the suitable
compilation options are set up.</p>
