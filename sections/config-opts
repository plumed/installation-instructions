<p>You can control the compilers and compiler flags that are used to build PLUMED by setting the environmental variables. For example, if you wanted to use
the icpc and icc compilers you might use the command shown in the example below:</p>

@configure("./configure CXX=icpc CC=icc CXXFLAGS=-O3 LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LIBS=-lmyxdrfile" copts1)@

<p>You can enable and disable various features within PLUMED by using the --enable-FEATURE and --disable-FEATURE options during the configure step. We would
recommend using a configure command with the following options enabled.</p>

@configure("./configure LIBRARY_PATH=/path --enable-rpath --enable-modules=all --enable-mpi --enable-asmjit --enable-external-lapack --enable-molfile-plugins --prefix=/usr/local" copts2)@
