<h2> Installing PLUMED </h2>
<p>You can install PLUMED using the command:</p>
<pre class="fragment">
&gt; make install
</pre>
<p>or the command:</p>
<pre class="fragment">
&gt; sudo make install
</pre>
<p>If you want to install PLUMED in a system directory. Unless modifications are made to the standard autoconf directories this command copies the
executable to <code>$(prefix)/bin</code>, the libraries to <code>$(prefix)/lib</code>,
the include files to <code>$(prefix)/include</code>, and the documentation to <code>$(prefix)/shared/doc/plumed</code>. A directory called
<code>$(prefix)/lib/plumed</code> is also created by this command. This directory contains several other files, including
the patch files and the object files that are used for static patching.</p>
<p><code>$(prefix)</code> here is the directory specified using the <a onclick="openModal('prefix')">--prefix</a> keyword of the configure script.</p>
<p>Once PLUMED has been installed using the <code>make install</code> command you can delete the original compilation directory
or you can recompile a different PLUMED version in the same place. You should not delete any of the installed files, however, as
<a onclick="openModal('standaloneexecutable')">PLUMED will not run</a> if there are files missing from these directories</p>
