<p>The easiest way to setup the environment is to use <a href="http://modules.sourceforge.net">the module framework</a>.
A suitable module file for PLUMED can be found in <code>$(prefix)/lib/plumed/src/lib/modulefile</code> after installation is completed.
You can edit this file or just put it into your modulefile directory directly. If you do so it is then straightforward to
set up the environment. </p>
<p> Notice that if you have installed more than one version of PLUMED on your machine you can use the module framework to easily
switch between them. </p>
<p> Lastly note that even if you do not want to use modules it may still be useful to look at the modulefile as this file will tell
you which environment variables need to be set for PLUMED to work correctly. </p>
