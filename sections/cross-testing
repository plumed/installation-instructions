<h2> Testing PLUMED </h2>
<p>If you have compiled the executable on a machine that is different from the one on which you will ultimately run it the
<code>plumed</code> executable is not available in the compilation environment. You thus cannot perform the regtests on
the machine and you cannot compile the manual.</p>

<p>You might try to run the regtests on the computing nodes in this case. You may need to do some tweaks to get this
to work as machines where people do cross-compiling often have architectures with limited capabilities on the compute nodes.</p>

<h2> Patching MD codes with a cross compiled code </h2>
<p>As discussed in the previous section, if PLUMED has been cross compiled the <code>plumed</code> executable is not available in the compilation environment.
You thus cannot run <code>plumed patch</code> on the compiler nodes. It is also likely that it will not be possible to run this command on the compute nodes
as on machines where cross compilation is necessary it is often not possible to fork new processes from the compute nodes. To get around these issues you can
use the command: </p>
<pre class="fragment">
&gt; plumed-patch
</pre>
<p>instead. This script provides a "shell only" implementation of <code>plumed patch</code> and thus does not launch of the <code>plumed</code> executable.
You can thus run this command (and patch MD codes) on the compiler nodes. If you have installed PLUMED you can find the <code>plumed-patch</code> code
script (and some other similar shell scripts that allow you to run various plumed command line tools without launching the <code>plumed</code> executable)
in the directory <code>$(prefix)/plumed/plumed-</code>. The reason these files are not included in the execution path (prefix/bin) is to avoid clashes.</p>
