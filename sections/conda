<h1>Installing PLUMED with conda</h1>
<p>If you use the conda package manager you can quictkly install a pre-compiled PLUMED binary by using the following command: </p>
<pre class="fragment">&gt; conda install -c conda-forge plumed </pre>
<p> Similarly, the python wrappers can be installed by using the command: </p>
<pre class="fragment">&gt; conda install -c conda-forge py-plumed </pre>
<p>These packages are part of <a href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge">conda-forge</a>. They should thus be binary compatible with other codes from
the same distribution. Furthermore, it should also be possible to combine the PLUMED kernel installed from conda with an MD code that has been compiled outside
of conda (or within a different conda environment) if PLUMED is linked in runtime mode. The only variable that you need to set in order to access to the PLUMED kernel
that is installed through conda is <code>PLUMED_KERNEL</code> (e.g., <code>export PLUMED_KERNEL=/conda/prefix/lib/libplumedKernel.so</code>).</p>

<p>Conda binaries are only available for Linux and macOS. The installed conda binaries were configured using the command:</p>

@configure-conda@

<p> so the features are limited accordindly. Notice that there additional conda packages are available on the <a href="https://anaconda.org/plumed/plumed">plumed</a> channel.
These packages are for testing only.</p>
