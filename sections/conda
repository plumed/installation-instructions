<h1><a class="anchor" id="Installation-conda"></a>Installing PLUMED with conda</h1>
<p>If you use the conda package manager you can quictkly install a pre-compiled PLUMED binary by using the following command: </p>
<pre class="fragment">&gt; conda install -c conda-forge plumed </pre>
<p> Similarly, the python wrappers can be installed by using the command: </p>
<pre class="fragment">&gt; conda install -c conda-forge py-plumed </pre>
<p>These packages are part of <a href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge">conda-forge</a>. They should thus be binary compatible with other codes from
the same distribution. Furthermore, it should also be possible to combine the PLUMED kernel installed from conda with an MD code that has been compiled outside
of conda (or within a different conda environment) if PLUMED is linked in runtime mode. The only variable that you need to set in order to access to the PLUMED kernel
that is installed through conda is <code>PLUMED_KERNEL</code> (e.g., <code>export PLUMED_KERNEL=/conda/prefix/lib/libplumedKernel.so</code>).</p>

<p>Conda binaries are only available for Linux and macOS. The installed conda binaries were configured using the command:</p>

@configure-conda@

<p> so the features are limited accordindly. Notice that there additional conda packages are available on the <a href="https://anaconda.org/plumed/plumed">plumed</a> channel.
These packages are for testing only.</p>

<h1>Calling PLUMED from python</h1>
<p>It is possible to call PLUMED 2.5 and later versions in a python script. If you would like to do so you simply add the command below in your python script:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a name="l00001"></a><span class="lineno">  1</span>&#160;<span class="keyword">import</span> plumed</div></div>
<p>The interface is designed with developers in mind rather than users as the interface from python to PLUMED is similar to the interface that is used to link PLUMED
with the various MD codes. If you are only compiling one version of PLUMED you might configure using the command: </p>

@configure("./configure PYTHON_BIN=python3.6 --prefix=$HOME/opt" python1)@

<p>Once you have compiled and installed PLUMED by following the instructions that are laid out in the sections that follow, the python wrappers for PLUMED will be in
<code>$HOME/opt/plumed/python</code>. To use plumed in a python script the location of these wrappers must be added <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable using
a command such as the one shown below:</p>
<pre class="fragment">
&gt; PYTHONPATH="$HOME/opt/lib/plumed/python:$PYTHONPATH"
</pre>
<p>If you have installed muliple PLUMED versions you might find it easier to install the Python wrappers and PLUMED separately. The simplest way to install the python
wrappers by themselves is with <code>pip</code> as shown below:</p>
<pre class="fragment">
&gt; pip3.6 install --user plumed
</pre>
<p> In the command above the <code>--user</code> flag allows you to install the packages on your home. Notice also that you don't even need to download
PLUMED in order to install the wrappers. The command above can be run before you configure, compile and install PLUMED. You will, however, need PLUMED
in order to use it within a python script. You can tell the wrappers where PLUMED is by setting the <code>PLUMED_KERNEL</code> environment variable as shown
below:</p>
<pre class="fragment">
&gt; PLUMED_KERNEL=$HOME/opt/lib/libplumedKernel.so
</pre>
<p>When you install the wrappers in this manner described above you will download those that are packaged on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/plumed/">[Pypi]</a>.
If you want to install the development version of the wrappers using pip you should download the PLUMED repository and use the following commands:</p>
<pre class="fragment">
&gt; pip3.6 install --user cython
&gt; cd plumed2/python
&gt; make pip
&gt; pip3.6 install --user .
</pre>
<p>You are highly recommended to use a virtualenv when installing the development version as you will then ensure that the code you install does not interfere with the released pacakages.</p>
