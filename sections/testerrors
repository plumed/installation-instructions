<p>If you see errors when you run the regression tests using the commands:</p>
<pre class="fragment">
&gt; cd regtest
&gt; make
</pre>
<p>The first thing you should try to work out is the version of PLUMED that is being used to run the tests. When the tests are run
using the commands above the version of PLUMED that is found in the PATH is used. If the version of PLUMED in your path is not the same
as the version that you just downloaded and compiled then you may observe one of two innocuous errors:</p>
<ul>
<li> If the PLUMED executable in your path is older than the test suite you are running on the tests might fail. In this case the tests
fail as some feature was introduced to PLUMED in a newer version.</li>
<li> The tests might also fail if the PLUMED executable in your path is newer than the test suite. In this case some non-backward compatible change
 was made in PLUMED. We try to keep the number of non-backward compatible changes small, but as you can see from the <a class="el" href="_change_log.html">ChangeLog</a> there
 are typically a few non-compatable changes at every new major release.</li>
</ul>
