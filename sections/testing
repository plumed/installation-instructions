<h2> Testing PLUMED </h2>
<p>It is important to test PLUMED every time you install PLUMED, as Even though we regularly perform tests on
<a href="https://github.com/plumed/plumed2/actions">GitHub actions</a>, it is possible that aggressive optimization or even architecture dependent features
trigger bugs that do not show up on GitHub. To test the PLUMED executable that you have installed you should, therefore, type</p>
<pre class="fragment">&gt; make installcheck </pre>
<p>Running this command tells PLUMED to run all the tests in the test suite using the version of PLUMED that was just installed. If you would like to test
PLUMED using some other PLUMED version then you can. The tests can be run using the PLUMED executable that is in your current path by using the commands: </p>
<pre class="fragment">
&gt; cd regtest
&gt; make
</pre>
<p>To determine the version of PLUMED that has been run using the commands above you can use the command:</p>
<pre class="fragment">
&gt; which plumed
</pre>
<p>When you do this you might get certain <a onclick='showData("testerrors","errdiv")'>innocous errors</a></p>
