@question@ Compiling on a Cray machine

<p>
On Cray machines you often have to set the <code>CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE</code> environmental variable
before configuring and building both PLUMED and the MD code that you want to patch with PLUMED.
You can set this variable using the command:
<p>
<pre class="fragment">
export CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic
</pre> 
<p> Our thanks to Marco De La Pierre for reporting this requirement</p>
