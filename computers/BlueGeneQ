@question@ Compiling on a Blue Gene Q

<p> 
On Blue Gene Q (likely on AIX) the prelinking made with <code>ld -r</code> is not
working properly. There is no easy way to detect this at configure time.
If, however, you receive an error in the form:
</p>
<pre class="fragment">
ld: TOC section size exceeds 64k
</pre>
<p> when you run <code>make</code> please configure PLUMED again using the flag <code>--disable-ld-r</code></p>
