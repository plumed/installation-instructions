@question@ Compiling on machines with different levels of hardware

<p>
PLUMED needs to be well optimized to run efficiently.
If you need a single PLUMED binary to run efficiency on machines with different levels of hardware (for example, if 
some of your workstations support AVX and some do not), then with then intel compiler you can use 
a configure command like the one shown below:</p>

@configure("./configure CXX=mpicxx CXXFLAGS='-O3&-axSSE2,AVX'" diffLev1)@

<p>This will take more time to compile but it will allow you to use a single module. If you cannot use this option, you should install two
PLUMED versions with different optimization levels.</p>
