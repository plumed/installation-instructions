@question@ Compiling a no-mpi version of PLUMED

<p>
It is usually not necessary to install both an MPI and a non-MPI PLUMED version of PLUMED. The PLUMED library only calls MPI functions
when the MD code is compiled with MPI. Furthermore, the PLUMED executable can be invked with a <code>--no-mpi</code> flag on the login node
as shown below:</p>
<pre class="fragment">
&gt; plumed --no-mpi
</pre>
<p>This command will run even if PLUMED was compiled with MPI and the login node does not support MPI.
The only cases where you might need two different PLUMED installations for the compute
and login node is when you are cross compiling.</p>
